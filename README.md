>> NLP project chatbot using deep learning model

As further improvements you can try different tasks to enhance performance and features.
Use more data to train: You can add more data to the training dataset. A large dataset with a good number of intents can lead to making a powerful chatbot solution.
Apply different NLP techniques: You can add more NLP solutions to your chatbot solution like NER (Named Entity Recognition) in order to add more features to your chatbot. With having a NER model along with your chatbot, you can easily find out any entity that appeared in user chat messages and use it for further conversations. And also you can add a Sentiment Analysis model to identify different sentiment tones behind user messages and it will exactly give some additional colors to your chatbot.
Try different neural network architectures: You can also try different neural network architectures with different hyperparameters.
Add emojis: You can also consider emojis when building your models.
